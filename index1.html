            <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and make decisions like humans. AI systems are designed to perform tasks such as problem-solving, speech recognition, planning, learning, and perception. These systems rely on algorithms and large datasets to improve their performance over time.</p>
